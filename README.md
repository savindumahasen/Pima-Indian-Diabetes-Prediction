# Pima-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction
This is Machine Learning (ML) project. For completing this project I used the three four supervised learning algorithms. To make the the prediction dataset is recieved from kaggle website. Main purpose of this project is predict wether ipeole have infected the diabetes or not.


# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
